## Gather Your Salesforce Credentials

1. To pull salesforce (cyschoolhouse) data, you will need a certain email, password, and security token. This is the same as those needed to connect to salesforce through Power BI.
2. Your email login will be in the form `xxxxxxx@cityyear.org.cyschorgb`
3. Your password might not be the same as used in Okta. Submit a service desk ticket with category: *Network and Systems*, and subcategory: *cyschoolhouse: System Access* for an email to configure the password associated with your `xxxxxxx@cityyear.org.cyschorgb` salesforce account. Note: this will not affect your Okta universal login.
4. Log in to salesforce as usual
5. Navigate to settings
